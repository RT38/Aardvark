#### Purpose
Monitors Primary Weather Data + Soil Moisture and Temperature
Sends Data to Ubidots
Measured Variables:
Ambient Temp and RH, Dewpoint, Rain Precip, Solar irradiance
Soil moisture and temp at 3 locations (or depths 0-5, 20-25 & 60-65 cm), battery voltage

##### Version 3.1
Updated 28NOV2018
Move averaging of values to the send time instead of its own 1 minute time which was dumb because it was over writing the variables every minute

Added Battery Check SOC code from Particle to avoid brown outs. Set to 10% and 60 minute wake up timer.

Updated 12/24/2017
 Created clear stats subroutine
 Change sm constant from unsigned int ==> float
 change st constant from int ==> float

 // DATA===============================
// Sample every 10 seconds
// Precip: Hr  total, 24 hr Cummulative
// Soil Moisture: 5 min Average: Capacitive -> Volumetric
// Soil Temperature: 5 Min average
// Soil Probe Depths: 5-10, 20-25, 60-65cm
// 5 min wind avg speed
// 5 min wind Gust
